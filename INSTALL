#### Installation Instructions ####

### Building the Libraries

1. Download the boost library (http://www.boost.org). This is a free, high 
   quality, open source C++ library used extensively by ITensor and 
   potentially helpful for your own application development.

2. Edit the user configurable options. Start by making a copy of the sample 
   options file: 'cp options.mk.sample options.mk'. Then edit options.mk in 
   your favorite text editor. 

   You must make sure that BOOST_DIR points to the location of 
   your unpacked boost libraries folder (the default is a folder called 
   'boost' located one directory above this file). 

   If you are using a system other than a Mac, edit PLATFORM, 
   BLAS_LAPACK_INCLUDEFLAGS and BLAS_LAPACK_LIBFLAGS to reflect the 
   type and location of your BLAS/LAPACK libraries. The list of currently
   available platforms is: macos, mkl, acml. The PLATFORM variable selects
   which matrix/$(PLATFORM)_utility.cc file will be used to wrap
   vendor-specific BLAS/LAPACK fortran calls into C.

3. Finally, at the top level of the library (same directory as this file), 
   type "make". 
   If all goes well, the built library files should appear in the LIBDIR 
   folder specified in options.mk.

### Building the sample and sandbox apps

We have provided sample applications under the 'sample' directory. Also, we 
have provided a 'sandbox' folder with some apps for you to modify to 
experiment with the library's features.

To build these apps, simply 'cd' into each folder and type 'make'. Or, to 
build an individual app type 'make <appname>'.

### Linking your own applications to the libraries

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes the library has issues compiling if the make "-j" flag is used 
(this flag enables parallel compilation on multi-core machines). Try 
disabling it (e.g. explicitly type "make -j 1") if you have compilation 
errors.
